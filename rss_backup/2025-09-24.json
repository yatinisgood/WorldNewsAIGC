He told RN:</p><p>I don’t know that I would call it a low point. It’s a point of stress. That’s fair to say. It’s a point of strong disagreement, not mild. This is a strong disagreement. And we feel like the government of Australia has made a very serious mistake.</p><p>Well, it would tell me that not everybody in Australia agrees with maybe the leadership. And I’m comforted by that because it does tell me that there are those who are looking at this from what’s best for not just the Middle East, but best really for a global resolve of a situation that is hurting many and helping no one.</p><p>The United States’ position is one of strong disagreement with nations that are calling unilaterally for a Palestinian state. … The bigger problem is something that we continue to try to say to these European nations, to Australia, to Canada, and others. It is having the opposite effect of what I think these countries want …</p><p>I think it’s possible for nations to disagree on some things and agree on others and still maintain a relationship. <strong>That’s not to say that there is not very, very strong disappointment, and perhaps the word disgust </strong>would be a more appropriate term for how the US feels toward what we thought are our friends.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2025/sep/24/australia-news-live-anthony-albanese-new-york-united-nations-donald-trump-climate-crisis-palestine-israel-gaza-ntwnfb\">Continue reading...</a>"
